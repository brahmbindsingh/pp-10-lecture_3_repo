all from our coverage tonight. See you tomorrow!<br><br></p><p><b>Agarwal:</b> KL Rahul is going for a surgery and hopefully he should be back. Would've liked two points but I guess we were about 10 short on that wicket. And the kind of powerplay they had we really had to scrap and fight. One batsman has to bat through, that was my plan. It was my day, I took that responsibility. Unfortunately we didn't get too many in the middle overs, even though we finished well. Would have loved two points more than anything else. But it is what it is. We have to shut this off, turn up next game and do better. Managing the ups and downs is what captaincy's all about. Kudos to Harpreet who showed up for us today and last game as well, he also hit a crucial boundary. We need to keep at it and click as a team.<br><br></p><p><b>Mayank Agarwal is the Player of the Match.</b><br><br></p><p><b>Pant:</b> I think Shikhy bhai and Prithvi gave us a very good start, that's why the innings looked much better. The first innings it was really gripping. The way they started was commendable. It feels so good when you have a great start each and every match with a mixture of youth and experience. You can see that everyone is doing so well around them. Most things are sorted out but we need to try out a few options for the Kolkata matches. The competition in the team is very good. When you see, there is a lot of gun bowling that we have. I'm enjoying everyday, using my experience, using the seniors around me. We are trying to make an environment where everyone feels good.</p><p><b>Dhawan</b> [orange cap holder now]: Really happy the way we chased down the score. Prithvi and myself gave a great start, what we needed. Smith chipped in nicely. I knew I had to go to the end because for the new batsman it was a little difficult. Once we knew that we can close the game quickly, we planned that we should finish in 19 overs. The way Hetmyer is hitting it is amazing. It's good to get the strike rate up and get the price up as well! (laughs) I keep tabs on both runs and strike rate, both sync. But it depends on the wicket as well, you have to respect it. Today there was dew, last two games there weren't. When it comes on nicely I take more risks. I've been playing with Prithvi for three years now. He makes it easy for me the way he strikes it. At the same time I stick to my process. Last match there was nothing to do from my side, but this match I knew I had to cash in.<br><br></p><div></div><p><hr></p><p>AbdulAleem : "This ipl is a table of two very clear halves. The top 4 and bottom 4 each will jostle amongst their respective halves"<br><br>Teapot: "Where do Punjab go from here? They didn't do much wrong with bat, given their lineup. I see them sliding to the bottom, if SRH permit though!"<br><br>Manu Ajmani: "How good of was Dhawan tonight holding one end with a healthy strike rate of 145? He has been such a reliable opener for DC continuing his form from last year. SRH must be ruing the fact they traded him after an 8 year stint ahead of the 2019 edition!"<br><br>Kapil Baldawa: "With the way Punjab bowl, nothing short of 190 would be enough. And they can be get there only with Pooran now with Rahul out. Just don't see them winning with such poor bowling, especially from experienced guys like Shami"<br><br>smugs: "@Tasmeem: Not sure about that, Billings or Hetmyer could have played a similar knock and perhaps at a faster rate."<br><br>Vivaan : "Meredith doesn't seem to be a good death bowler, should bowl his 4 before the death overs"<br><br></p><p><hr></p><p><b>10.57pm</b> Delhi Capitals end the night as table toppers. We said at the halfway stage that Punjab may have something to defend, but there were big caveats on that: it was a relative measure, based on how they'd begun. And two, it was so dependent on getting one of Shaw or Dhawan early on. Like many other teams this season, they couldn't manage that. Shaw went blazing as he does, Dhawan took over in the middle overs after him and Smith had put up nearly 50 together. Hetmyer with freedom at the end to take Delhi past the total with more than two overs remaining. That'll be lovely for their net run-rate. Toothless bowling for the most part, from Punjab. They stay in sixth place.</p></div></div><div class="d-flex match-comment-padder align-items-center"><div class="col-2 col-md-1 col-lg-2 match-comment-run-col"><span

It was my day, I took that responsibility. Unfortunately we didn't get too many in the middle overs, even though we finished well. Would have loved two points more than anything else. But it is what it is. We have to shut this off, turn up next game and do better. Managing the ups and downs is what captaincy's all about.

You can see that everyone is doing so well around them. Most things are sorted out but we need to try out a few options for the Kolkata matches. The competition in the team is very good.

Prithvi and myself gave a great start, what we needed. Smith chipped in nicely. I knew I had to go to the end because for the new batsman it was a little difficult. Once we knew that we can close the game quickly, we planned that we should finish in 19 overs. The way Hetmyer is hitting it is amazing. It's good to get the strike rate up and get the price up as well! (laughs) I keep tabs on both runs and strike rate, both sync. But it depends on the wicket as well, you have to respect it. Today there was dew, last two games there weren't. When it comes on nicely I take more risks. I've been playing with Prithvi for three years now. He makes it easy for me the way he strikes it. At the same time I stick to my process.

We said at the halfway stage that Punjab may have something to defend, but there were big caveats on that: it was a relative measure, based on how they'd begun. And two, it was so dependent on getting one of Shaw or Dhawan early on. Like many other teams this season, they couldn't manage that. Shaw went blazing as he does, Dhawan took over in the middle overs after him and Smith had put up nearly 50 together. Hetmyer with freedom at the end to take Delhi past the total with more than two overs remaining. That'll be lovely for their net run-rate. Toothless bowling for the most part, from Punjab.
